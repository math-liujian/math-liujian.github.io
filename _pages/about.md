Welcome!
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Systems Engineering & Engineering Management](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/) advised by Prof. [Huifu Xu](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~hfxu/index.html).
Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained my Master's degree in the School of Mathematical Sciences from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My research interest lies in the discrete choice model and optimal decision-making under uncertainty. You can find my CV here.
